Malware "Small-Net-Rat" (5.0) by http://small-net-rat.blogspot.com/
This is not the latest version, but is the one that im sure is working and dont contain any bd in it.
Can be useful for little operations.
This malware have a builder that is able to build a full .exe or a downloader, both cases requires a packer because the included one is outdated and the exe is exposed to all AV.
